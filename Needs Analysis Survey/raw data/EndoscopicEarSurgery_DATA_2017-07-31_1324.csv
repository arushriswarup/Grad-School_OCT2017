The Storz curved suctions I have in my set are too flimsy, too thin and too long.  A device to suction smoke during laser surgery mounted on the laser tip or separate would be very useful.  In regards of cutting bone, I have found the piezoelectric drill quite useful. In regards of bleeding control, I feel that with experience and optimal injection I can manage with intermittently suctioning the field and placing cotton balls.  In regards of graft positioning, I manage well with traditional middle ear instruments.",2

It would help two handed technique.  there has been one developed by Dr Mubarak Khan which removed the microscope head from the stand and adapts it to the endoscope.  There has to be a simpler and safer alternative. In fact I do have some ideas that I would be happy to discuss.    Another area is the whirlybirds are not  long enough to dissect cholesteatomas fro the sinus tympani if it is deep.  the instrument needs to be modified.      Arun K. Gadre +1 (502) 381 3398,2
